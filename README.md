# Super Galactic Age Calculator
### Week 11 independent project, March 30, 2019
### By: Jasmine Lee

### Description:
A web application calculator that takes the birthdate (Earth) a user to inputs and outputs their age on Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, along with the number of years they have left to live until they reach their average life expectancy (80) on each of those planets. If they exceed their life expectancy on those planets, the program returns the number of years they've lived past their life expectancy on each of those planets.
